    /*O(n) time and constant memory
The problem can be defined by the next recurrence function

f(x,y) = max(g(x) + f(x+2,y-1), f(x+1,y))   if x = 0
         max(g(x) + f(x+2,y), f(x+1,y))     if 1 <= x < y
         0                                  if x >= y

where function g(n) returns the value of the nth house

In function f, "x" represents the house nÂº x and "y" the length of the array we are considering.
In every step (every call to this function) we must decide either we rob the house or not.
If we do so, we must add the value associated to this house and move 2 positions (since adjacent houses, 
if one of them robbed, would active the security alarm).
If we dont, we just move to the next house.

Because the first and last houses are also adjacent, if we decide to rob the first one, we must somehow 
avoid robbing the last one (it won't be robbed and also mustn't).
This is done by reducing the lparameter "y" by 1 unit, y - 1, which is done exclusively in
this case so the scope of the function doesn't reach the last house.

Here's an example:
    g = [1,2,3,1], len = 4

    f(0,4) = max(1+f(2,3), f(1,4)) = 4
        f(2,3) = max(3+f(4,3), f(3,3)) = 3
            f(4,3) = 0
            f(3,3) = 0
        f(1,4) = max(2+f(3,4), f(2,4)) = 3
            f(3,4) = max(1+f(5,4), f(4,4)) = 1
                f(5,4) = 0
                f(4,4) = 0
            f(2,4) = max(3+f(4,4), f(3,4)) = 3

    f(0,len) is the value we are looking for and its calculation depends on f(2,len-1) and f(1,len).

    To calculate f(0,4) we can start from the bottom, f(5,4), so there is no need to wait for the next 
	values to be calculated. 
	WHY?
	In one step, we have this assignment:
        x = max(c+y, z), where c = value of the nth house
    We observe that the next assignment will always satisfy this rule
        x' = max(c+z, x)
        x'' = max(c+x, x')
		x''' = max(c+x', x'')
        ...

    This way, the calculation can be done in a simple O(n) loop swapping accordingly the values "y" 
	and "z". 
	
	We start from f(len+1,len) and go decrementing x by 1 until we reach 0:

    f(5,4) = 0
    f(4,4) = 0
    f(3,4) = max(1+f(5,4), f(4,4)) = 1
    f(2,4) = max(3+f(4,4), f(3,4)) = 3
    f(1,4) = max(2+f(3,4), f(2,4)) = 3
    f(0,4) = max(1+f(2,3), f(1,4)) = ?? -> We see that we don't know f(2,3) yet, because it's a 
										   calculation wich considers a different length.

    However, f(2,3) calculated the same way as we've been doing so far, staring from f(len'+1,len'),
	where len' = len - 1, and stop decrementing when we reach x = 1:

    f(4,3) = 0
    f(3,3) = 0
    f(2,3) = max(3+f(4,3), f(3,3)) = 3

    No we're free to go

    f(0,4) = max(1+f(2,3), f(1,4)) = max(1+3, 3) = 4, which is the value we're looking for
